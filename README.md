# Airflow ETL Docker Setup: A Comprehensive Beginner's Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through setting up a complete, production-style Apache Airflow environment on your local machine using Docker. We'll also build and run a sample ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

What is Apache Airflow?
Apache Airflow is a powerful tool used to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows. Think of it as a way to manage complex chains of tasks, like data pipelines, in a reliable and observable way. For example: "Fetch data from an API every hour, clean it up, load it into a database, and then train a machine learning model."

## Part 1: Setting Up the Environment
### Prerequisites
Docker Desktop: A tool that allows you to build and run "containers" (isolated application environments). If you don't have it, you can download it from the official Docker website.
Docker Compose: A tool included with Docker Desktop that lets you manage multi-container applications using a simple configuration file.

### Project Structure
First, you need to create a specific folder structure on your computer. Airflow and Docker are configured to look for these exact folders.

airflow-etl-project/
├── dags/
├── logs/
├── plugins/
├── .env
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── Dockerfile
└── requirements.txt

### What are these folders for?

dags/: This is the most important folder. You will place all your workflow definitions (your Python DAG files) here. Airflow automatically scans this folder and loads your workflows.
logs/: Airflow will store the execution logs from your workflow runs in this folder.
plugins/: If you create custom Airflow plugins (like custom UI elements or hooks), they go here.
The other files are configuration files that we will use to define our setup.

## Step 1: Place the Project Files

Put the docker-compose.yaml, Dockerfile, .env, and requirements.txt files directly inside your airflow-etl-project/ directory. Place the stream_etl_dag.py file inside the dags/ subdirectory.
